# Architecture Decision Records

## Numbering Scheme

| Range | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0000-0005 | Shared | Cross-tool decisions. All 4 tools follow these. |
| 0006+ (per tool) | Tool-specific | Each tool numbers its own ADRs starting from 0006. |
| S00XX | Shared additions | Post-initial shared decisions added during alignment. |

- **Shared ADRs** are maintained in `docs/shared-adr/` within each tool repository. All four tools keep identical copies.
- **Tool-specific ADRs (0006+)** live in each tool's own `docs/adr/` with numbering starting at 0006.
- Semgrep rules enforcing shared ADRs are copied to each tool's `.semgrep/shared-adr.yaml`.

## Shared ADRs (see: [docs/shared-adr/](../shared-adr/))

| # | Decision |

| 0002 | stdio convention (stdout=data, stderr=logs) |
| 0003 | OpenTelemetry noop-default + OTLP HTTP |
| 0004 | D-Mail Schema v1 specification |
| 0005 | fsnotify-based file watch daemon |
